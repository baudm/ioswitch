These benchmarks require fio (see http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/131063)

The usage is as follows:

$ ./run.sh <benchmark>.fio

----------------

For benchmarking the stock schedulers, create a folder named "log" and start benchmark.sh using sudo.

$ mkdir log
$ sudo ./benchmark.sh

fio files to be used are:

rand-read.fio
rand-write.fio
seq-read.fio
seq-write.fio

These files should have the same configuration except for the direction and nature of the I/O (randread, randwrite, read, write).
